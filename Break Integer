Algorithm Overview:

Check if n is 2 or 3 and return the appropriate value.
Divide n into as many threes as possible and handle the remainder for maximizing the product.
Multiply the result based on the division and the remainder.
Detailed Explanation:

Check for n being 2 or 3:

If (n) equals 2, return 1 (as specified in the problem).
If (n) equals 3, return 2 (as specified in the problem).
Divide n into as many threes as possible:

Calculate the maximum number of threes that can be obtained from (n) using integer division ((n // 3)).
Calculate the remainder after dividing (n) by 3 ((n % 3)).
Handle remainder to maximize the product:

If the remainder is 1:
Borrow one from a three to make two 2s by decrementing threes by 1 and setting remainder to 4.
If the remainder is 0:
Set remainder to 1 (no need to borrow).
Calculate the final product:

Calculate the product by raising 3 to the power of threes ((3) raised to the power of (threes)) and multiplying by the remainder.
Here's the provided code implementing the above steps:

////////////////////////////////////////////// CODE///////////////////////////////////////////////

var integerBreak = function(n) {
  if(n===2){
    return 1;
  }  
  if(n===3){
      return 2;
  }

  //try to divide n into  as many threes as possible
  let threes = Math.trunc(n/3);
  let remainder = n%3;

  if(remainder === 1){
      threes -= 1; // remove 3*1
      remainder = 4 // create 2*2
  }
  else if(remainder ===0){
      remainder =1; // when reaminder is 0, set 1 which doesn't affect your answer
  }

  return Math.pow(3,threes)*remainder;
};
